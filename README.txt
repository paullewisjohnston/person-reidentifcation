This system generates the Augmented Amazon dataset using the web scraper and data augmentation system.

The system requires openCV java 2.14.13 libraries.
OpenCV set up is explained here: https://medium.com/@aadimator/how-to-set-up-opencv-in-intellij-idea-6eb103c1d45c

Other required libraries can be found in /lib/

The system currently contains a small sample dataset of images from 1 web page to keep the project filesize to a minimum

The system can be run to generate the full dataset or alternatively it can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/f9lsldsv7e36w8x/augmented.zip?dl=0
